# About me
## Intro
Hi, my name is Elisha-Grace! As a curious student of Software Engineering and Geography, I am currently entering my U2 (third year) at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I have ventured down many paths trying to find which topics of study both excite me and provide the tools nessecary to tackle problems I hope to help solve one day. 

This search eventually led me to study areas of sustainability and physical geography alongside software development and data science. With exposure to these topics in an academic setting, I hope to work on projects that will push our understanding of global resource challeneges, climate change effects, and environmental research.

My driving purpose comes from my love of the outdoors and longstanding passion to understand our Earth. This summer when I'm not working as a GIS Intern, I can be found on some local adventure hiking, trail running, and rock climbing in BC. 

**Let's connect and create something that will help the planet together!**
